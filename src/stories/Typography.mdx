# Typography

Fonts and styles for MUI [Typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/) component adapted from
[HY Design System](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=334495865) specs.

Note that `Typography` supports defining the semantic component separately from the style so that the heading
hierarchy can be organized correctly (see [Accessibility](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/#accessibility)).
